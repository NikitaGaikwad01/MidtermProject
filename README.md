## Apriori Algorithm in use to predict association rules
### Using the Apriori algorithm, generation of the association rules and the input transactions for each of the 5 transactional databases that I had created. The support and confidence was a user-specified parameters, so the output showed different rules with respect to different databases and different support/confidence. There were multiple support and confidence results.
